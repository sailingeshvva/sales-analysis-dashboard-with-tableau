# Sales Analysis Dashboard – Tableau

## About This Project
This is a Tableau dashboard I made using the US Superstore dataset. It helps break down sales and profits by region, category, and shipping type. I used filters and charts to make it easy for someone to find out what’s working and what’s not in the business.

## What I Used
- Tableau
- Filters & Parameters
- Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Geo Maps

## What I Learned
- How to use Tableau to turn raw data into insights
- Creating visuals that highlight loss-making areas
- Making dashboards interactive with filters and drop-downs
